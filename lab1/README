The files obtained in this folder were obtained from the OpenCV Repo
https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/python/edge.py
I made modifications to the edge.py script and placed the results in
webcam.py. I added a Gaussian Blur effect to the image before processing
it as well as changed the colored outlines to blue instead of green.
